It is not only demographic change that is changing the demands placed on public road space. The demand and demand for barrier-free mobility, especially for people with physical disabilities, form the basis for many plans. The public street space shows In addition to obstructions caused by traffic infrastructures such as signs and stairs, there are also fundamental obstacles. Straight gradients are particularly suitable for older and mobility impaired people as well as wheelchair users are an enormous difficulty. The aim was to create a tool that would classify roads according to their gradients and display them on a map. With the presented tool, which was implemented in a combination of QGIS and R, the analysis of gradients in the road space can be carried out with geo basic data for entire cities and districts area-wide. must be carried out. Subsequently, a target group-specific division into classes is possible in order to to provide data to the public as a map or service.
